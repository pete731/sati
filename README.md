# SATI: Solana Agent Trust Infrastructure

[![License: CC0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC0-green.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
[![Status: Community Standard (Proposed)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Proposed-yellow.svg)]()

**Solana's answer to Ethereum's ERC-8004** - A four-registry protocol enabling autonomous AI agents to establish verifiable identity, accumulate portable reputation, manage user delegation, and handle payment mandate lifecycle across organizational boundaries.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Solana has **50,000+ AI agents** deployed (ElizaOS, Solana Agent Kit, GOAT) but **zero formal standards** for:
- ✗ Agent identity and discovery
- ✗ Cross-platform reputation
- ✗ User-to-agent delegation
- ✗ Payment mandate lifecycle (IntentMandate/CartMandate)
- ✗ Work validation proofs

Meanwhile, Ethereum has ERC-8004 and Google's AP2 protocol. Protocols like Hubble AI choose Base because Solana lacks complete agent infrastructure.

**SATI fixes this.** First Solana standard with **complete AP2 support.**

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

SATI provides four composable registries:

### 1. Identity Registry (SATI-native, ZK Compressed)
- Globally unique agent identifiers
- DID support (did:solana, did:pkh, did:web)
- Protocol endpoint discovery (A2A, MCP, AP2)
- **Cost: $2,000 for 1M agents** (vs $3.4M traditional)

### 2. Reputation Registry (SATI-native, Event-Based)
- Pre-authorized client feedback (spam resistant)
- x402 payment proof integration
- Off-chain details with on-chain commitments
- **150ms finality** with Alpenglow

### 3. Delegation Registry (SAS-based Attestations)
- User→agent authorization with expiry
- Capability scoping and spending limits
- Built on Solana Attestation Service primitives

### 4. Mandate Registry (SATI-native, ZK Compressed)
- **Full AP2 IntentMandate & CartMandate support**
- Lifecycle states (Active/Revoked/Executed/Zombie/Amended)
- Context drift detection (prevents "zombie mandates")
- Revalidation triggers for changed user context
- **First Solana solution to AP2 mandate lifecycle problem**

**Plus:** TEE validation attestations (Phala, Intel TDX, AMD SEV) via SAS

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/tenequm/sati.git
cd sati

# Install dependencies (uses pnpm)
pnpm install

# Build programs (requires Anchor 0.32.1+)
anchor build

# Build SDK
cd sdk && pnpm build

# Run tests
anchor test
```

**Note:** This is a scaffolded repository. Full implementation planned for Q1 2026 (13-week roadmap).

**Requirements:**
- Rust 1.89.0
- Solana CLI 1.18+
- Anchor 0.32.1+
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (not npm/yarn)

## 🎯 Use Cases

**For Agent Frameworks:**
- ElizaOS, Solana Agent Kit, GOAT can use SATI for identity
- Agents gain portable reputation across platforms
- Cross-framework agent discovery becomes possible

**For Payment Protocols:**
- x402 agents get verifiable identities
- Payment proofs integrate with reputation
- **Full AP2 mandate lifecycle support** (IntentMandate/CartMandate)
- Context drift detection prevents "zombie mandate" chargebacks
- Value-weighted feedback prevents Sybil attacks

**For Enterprises:**
- Hubble AI can build on Solana (complete AP2 + ERC-8004 compatibility)
- Trust infrastructure for PayAI ecosystem
- Cross-chain agent interoperability (Solana ↔ Ethereum)
- Regulatory compliance (context revalidation for subscription-style payments)
